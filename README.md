# RaidExtractor
A tool made to extract information from the windows version of "Raid: Shadow Legends". Currently it supports v.251 (as seen in Plarium Play launcher).

This application has 2 Modes:
* A Windows GUI application. The functionality is slim, but it works!
* A Non-GUI mode, which simply outputs the files as required.
  * Include **--nogui** or **-g** when running the application to run without a GUI.
  * Use **-o "output file name and path"** to specify the output file.
  * Use **-t "zip/json"** to pick the output mode. By default, this is set to **json**
  * If No Parameters are specified other than **--nogui/-g**, the application will create an *artifacts.json* file right where the application is run.
